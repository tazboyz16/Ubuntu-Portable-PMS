Portable Ubuntu Plex Media server    

I just finished creating a portable Plex media server on my Acer aspire one netbook     

I do recommend if you do this with a netbook to have Plex Media Server on another computer to convert the media to portable versions so the netbook/laptop does not have to transcode for faster streams    



****I will be no longer be updating this for Repo, For I have started up my own GitLab Server to contiune this work. For those that are following this Repo and forking it I hope you enjoy the work I have done so far. Thank you!!!
